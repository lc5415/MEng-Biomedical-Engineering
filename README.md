# MEng-Biomedical-Engineering

This repository includes all code-related and technical work I did individually or in group throughout my 4 year MEng in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College (2015-2019). This includes work in C++, MATLAB, PCB design, COMSOL, SolidWorks and Finite-Element Analysis (FEA).

## C++
Throughout my Programming I and Programming II courses I learnt C and C++. I learnt objected-oriented programming (OOP), dealing with pointers and adresses as well as general programming concepts (for, while, if-else statements, object types...)

## MATLAB
