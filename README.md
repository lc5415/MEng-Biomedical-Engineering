# MEng-Biomedical-Engineering

This repository includes code-related and technical comouter work I did individually or in group throughout my 4 year MEng in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College (2015-2019). This includes work in C++, MATLAB, PCB design, COMSOL, SolidWorks and Finite-Element Analysis (FEA).

# DISCLAIMER:
_I include in this repository all relevant courseworks or projects I completed. All practicals I completed throughout my degree are listed to show the variety and volume of subjects I was trained on. The respective files/scripts of those practicals are not included given the code from those was not entirely a product of my independent work but that of TAs and Course leaders.

## C++
__Courses__: *Programming I and Programming II*
Throughout my Programming I and Programming II courses I learnt C and C++. I learnt objected-oriented programming (OOP), dealing with pointers and adresses as well as general programming concepts (for, while, if-else statements, object types...)

## MATLAB
__Courses__: *Signals & Systems, Control Systems, Modelling in biology, Brain Machine Interfaces, Computational Neuroscience, iGEM competition, Master's thesis*
### Computational Neuroscience (Year 4)
__Learning Outcomes:__  
__Relevant work:__ Practicals on modelling ion channels in single neurons, single neurons responses, groups of neurons through synapses and networks of neurons.
### Brain Machine Interfaces (Year 4)
__Learning Outcomes:__Understand the way in which as of today the nervous system can be interfaced with electronic devices. Understanding the challenging faced when designing brain-machine interfaces.  
__Relevant work:__ Development of a script to predict hand movement of a monkey from Brain EEG signals using A Naive-Bayes Classifiers and a linear regressor. Report and code available.
### MEng Thesis - Curve fitting algorithms for Growth curve analysis and pipetting robot automation scripts(Year 4)
__Relevant work:__ Develop curve fitting alogrithms with optional choice of loss fonctions (RMSE, AIC, cross-entropy...) for fitting growth curve of biological organism from plate-reader experiments. Alternatively developed a script (from Alice Boo's original script) to help in the automation of diltion protocol for plate-reader experiments.
### iGEM Competition 2018 (Year 3)
__Relevant work__: Modelling of a complex biological single cell system with a set of 15+ ODEs and development of curve fitting algorithms.
### Modelling in Biology (Year 3)
__Learning outcomes:__  
__Relevant work:__ Set of computer practicals on bifurcation analysis, solving systems of ODEs, network analysis and modelling of Markov Chains + Coursework
### Signals & Systems (Year 2)
__Learning Outcomes:__ Understanding the nature of signals  
__Relevant work:__ Practicals on numerical implementation of Fourier Series and Fourier transforms(continuous and discrete) with fake signal s as well as with real ECG data.
### Control Systems (Year 2)
__Learning outcomes:__ Understanding Laplace transform, Linear-Time invariant systems, block diagrams, Poles and stability, transfer function, proportional–integral–derivative(PID) controller and state feedback control.  
__Relevant work:__ Numerical implementation of the above-mentioned concepts

## Finite Element Analysis (COMSOL, SolidWorks & Marc Mentat)
__Courses__: *Biomedical Advanced and Computational Stress Analysis(BACSA), iGEM Competition*
### BACSA (Year 3) -- SolidWorks and MarcMentat
__Learning Outcomes:__ Know and understand the principles of computational finite elemant analsysis(FEA), its advantages and drawbacks.  
__Relevant work:__ Testing (computational) and re-designing of a wheel bracket through FEA.
### iGEM Competition (Year 3) -- COMSOL
__Relevant work:__ Simulation an electrochemical reaction from a circular electrode into an semi-infinite space to check the feasibility of building a real bio-electrochemical interface.

## PCB/Circuit design (KiCAD)
__Courses__: *Biomedical Instrumentation and iGEM Competition*
### Biomedical Instrumentation (Year 3)
__Learning outcomes:__ Know and understand the structure of basic building blocks (e.g.op-amps) as well as their limitations and non-idealities. Understanding how the latter affect system-wide performance.  
__Relevant work__: Design and implementation of an op-amp based circuit for a biomedical device.
### iGEM PCB board (In collaboration with William Beardall)
__Aim:__ Designing an array of independent electrodes to be used as electrochemical cells (Purpose: allowing bio-electrical interface between electrodes and genetically modified *Escherichia Coli*.  
__Implementation and result:__ Designed and built a functional gold 14x14cm gold array with over 300 individual components.
