# Computational Neuroscience
## Instructed by Professor Claudia Clopath
## Aims:
 * To provide student with an appreciation of the role of computational and theoretical approaches to understanding the nervous system
 * To provide students with some practical skills of numerical tools to simulate Computational Neuroscience models\

## Description of practicals
 * __Practical 1__: Single Neuron Models, modelling voltage across a passive membrane /& integrate-and-fire model
 * __Practical 2__: Hodgkin-Huxley and Phase Plane Analysis, modelling of an ion channel and phase plane stability analysis
 * __Practical 3__: Single Neuron models, Piecewise linear Fitzhugh-Nagumo Model
 * __Practical 4__: Integrate-and-Fire model
 * __Practical 5__: Neural Network, modelling a ring network (inputs --> neurons --> networks)
 * __Practical 6__: Neural Networks, Spiking network
 * __Practical 7__: Synaptic plasticity, Bienenstock Cooper Munro (BCM) rule, Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
 * __Practical 8__: Synaptic plasticity, The Perceptron
 * __Practical 9__: Synaptic plasticity, Temporal Difference (TD) Learning
