Intro: How neurons work together "Who fires together, wires together"

Memory is encoded in connections between neurons. Associative memory, memory 
from associating related objects to a memory.

Structure of course:
3 main topics
-single neurons
- networks of neurones
- Synaptic plasticity (learning and memory)

Problem sets:
-single neurons [PEN AND PAPER]
- networks of neurones [ CODING]
- Synaptic plasticity (learning and memory)[CODING]

final exam: 100%
