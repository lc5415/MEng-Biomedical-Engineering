             The determinant of the stiffness matrix becomes zero or
             negative when indicated node has been reached during the
             Gaussian elimination phase of the solution process. This
             means that the stiffness matrix is non-positive definite.
             If this happens at the start of the analysis, the condition
             is usually caused by the existence of rigid body modes.  It
             may also be caused by incorrect material properties (e.g.
             Poisson's ratio greater than 0.5; note that such situations
             may arise through temperature dependence of properties). In
             nonlinear cases, the structure may have buckled or reached a
             plastic limit load. In rubber analysis, it may also be due
             to the strain state being in a region where the input data
             for the strain energy function is invalid. In contact
             analysis with friction, lack of normal forces may result in
             friction being absent. If desired, the program may be forced
             to continue by use of the parameter PRINT or the model or
             history definition option CONTROL. Either one of these
             procedures may be used for restart. Whenever a non-positive
             definite situation occurs one must exercise caution, as the
             resultant numerical solution may be infeasible.
